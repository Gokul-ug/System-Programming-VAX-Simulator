# System Programming Simulator

The **System Programming Simulator** is a web-based educational project that demonstrates the internal working of important system software components using interactive and visual simulations.  
It helps students understand low-level concepts such as **assemblers, macro processors, loaders, compilers, and CPU architecture** in a simple and practical way.

## Project Overview

This simulator is designed for academic learning and lab demonstrations.  
Each module works independently and shows how source code is processed step by step, including symbol table creation, memory allocation, instruction execution, and relocation.

## Modules Implemented

### 1. Assembler Simulator
- Converts pseudo-assembly code into assembly instructions
- Generates symbol table and memory map
- Supports step-by-step execution with logs

### 2. Macro Processor Simulator
- Allows macro definition and expansion
- Displays macro table
- Shows expanded code with step execution

### 3. Linking Loader Simulator
- Simulates two-pass linking loader
- Builds External Symbol Table (ESTAB)
- Performs relocation with step-by-step output

### 4. Mini Compiler & Loader Simulator
- Accepts simple high-level arithmetic statements
- Converts expressions into pseudo assembly
- Generates symbol table and memory map
- Supports step-by-step execution and output display

### 5. VAX Architecture Simulator
- Simulates VAX instruction execution cycle
- Visualizes Fetch, Registers, ALU, Memory, and PC
- Supports MOV, ADD, SUB, and HLT instructions
- Provides both step execution and continuous run mode
